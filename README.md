# PHP Project: Student Management System

## Project Description

This project is a simple student management system built with PHP and MySQL. It allows you to manage student information, such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers.

The project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, which means you can create, read, update, and delete student records.

If you're still a student, you can even use this to manage your own timetable, which I think is a nice touch!

## Project Notes

For this project I set it up in wsl and set up the docker files and connected to a local db (Mariadb) for development and used docker compose up to run the containers.

In this this project I wanted to get to grips with basic object-oriented programming (OOP), database management, and other essential programming concepts with PHP.
